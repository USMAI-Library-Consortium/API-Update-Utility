Welcome to the API update utility! 

This is a new project you've created. There's a few steps you'll need to go through
to get it up and running. 

You'll start by updating the config.json file. There's a few fields you'll need
to update:
1. xpath: If you're not overriding the built-in function to update the XML, you'll
    need to include the XML xpath pointing at the element you want to update. If
    you're adding or deleting an element rather than updating an element value, 
    point this to the element's parent.

2. xpathForGetResponseVerification: This verifies whether the XML returned by the
    API server is valid. You should include an xpath here pointing to an element 
    that a valid resource should ALWAY have, even if it's a root element like <user>
    or <vendor>

3. apiUrlTemplate: This is the format of the URL for the GET and PUT requests. You'll
    see an example URL there. As in the example, you should include <resource_id> 
    where the ID should go in the URL. Use that term exactly, this is what the program 
    swaps out for the resource ID. 

The other options are optional:
xpathOperation: This is whether you want to update, insert, or delete an element. Default
    is update. If you choose insert, you must include stringified XML as the value for 
    each resource. If you choose 'delete', you must include an xpath specifying which
    elements to delete RELATIVE TO THE MAIN XPATH (parent).
